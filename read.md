Decide on PHP or .NET

Create page for entire blog post that also includes section for comments and social networking

load more posts like facebook feed or tumblr dashboard

create favicon - paper airplane

write out text for each "work"

create horizontally long image (960px w by 250px tall or something, tall and skinny) that goes
below the post title but above the text or above the title.

maybe seperate blog posts like works are with horizontal bar.
