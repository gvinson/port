I like the top nav scrolling function when you scroll down. also think about making a better slide show instead of the "create the web" shit. and just have create the web under my name

Check out the section bottom borders. Maybe do something like that if you decide to split the sections by color and what not. (single page design)


<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>
	I <b>will</b> become a web leader, thats all there is to it. The web is 
	what I am passionate about, everything from graphics and videos to reports 
	and databases. I do it all, but I prefer front end development; I am a 
	sucker for watching designs and ideas come to life.
</p>
<p>
	I was introduced into the world of web development at the age of 13 but I 
	did not know that I could do this for the rest of my life. So, I became a 
	musician and started a few bands, released a few albums, went on a few US
	tours, signed on with a few record labels; it was great, best childhood you
	could ask for.
